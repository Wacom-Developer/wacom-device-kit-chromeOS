# Getting Started

For Android API based apps, please refer to [Wacom Device Kit: Android sample code ](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/wacom-device-kit-android)

For web based apps, we provide two sets of samples: 

- [Wintab ScribbleDemo - Getting Started ](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/wacom-device-kit-windows/blob/master/Wintab%20ScribbleDemo/GETTING-STARTED.md)
- A collection of open source touch/pointer tests and demos: https://github.com/patrickhlauke/touch

## Test Environment

To test the sample apps, use a recent released Wacom tablet on a Chrome OS 89 or later system.

## Verify tablet operation

1. Attach the Wacom tablet to your Chromebook.
2. Use a tablet pen to see if you can move the system cursor.
3. If your tablet supports touch, try moving the system cursor with your finger.
4. If all of the above checks out, you may now test the sample app as described in the next section.

## Testing the sample apps

The web app samples do not need to be built. You can test them by the following:

1. Open the Chrome browser.
2. Copy the HTML page onto the browser.
3. Once the page loads, you should be able to immediately use your pen, finger or mouse:
	* To draw on the page canvas area, see  [Wintab ScribbleDemo - Getting Started](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/wacom-device-kit-windows/blob/master/Wintab%20ScribbleDemo/GETTING-STARTED.md).
	* To view  pen events, see https://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/pen-tracker/index.html.
	* Or, to view pen and touch events, see https://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/tracker/multi-touch-tracker-pointer-hud-pep.html.

Alternately, you can simply double click on the HTML page and your default browser will open it automatically.
